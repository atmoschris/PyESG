Spherical Geometry
==================

Spherical geometry is a subject about the geometry on a sphere.
In this library, basic spherical geometries are introduced to serve the goal of regridding, so it may be not comprehensive for now.
The main fuctionalities of spherical geometry in this library are introduced below.

Distance between two points
---------------------------
This is the so-called `great-circle distance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance>`_.
The equation used in this library is

.. math::
    d = R \Delta \sigma,
where :math:`\sigma`
